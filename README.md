# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Create a SQL file in the Queries folder of your Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis GitHub folder, and name it Employee_Database_challenge.sql.

##Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title 

1. Retrieve the emp_no, first_name, and last_name columns from the Employees table.

2. Retrieve the title, from_date, and to_date columns from the Titles table.

3. Create a new table using the INTO clause.

4. Join both tables on the primary key.

9. Retrieve the employee number, first and last name, and title columns from the Retirement Titles table.
These columns will be in the new table that will hold the most recent title of each employee.

10. Use the DISTINCT ON statement to retrieve the first occurrence of the employee number for each set of rows defined by the ON () clause.

11. Exclude those employees that have already left the company by filtering on to_date to keep only those dates that are equal to '9999-01-01'.

12. Create a Unique Titles table using the INTO clause.

13. Sort the Unique Titles table in ascending order by the employee number and descending order by the last date (i.e., to_date) of the most recent title.

14. Export the Unique Titles table as unique_titles.csv and save it to your Data folder in the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis folder.

15. Before you export your table, confirm that it looks like this image:

16. Write another query in the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file to retrieve the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire.

17. First, retrieve the number of titles from the Unique Titles table.

18. Then, create a Retiring Titles table to hold the required information.

19. Group the table by title, then sort the count column in descending order.

20. Export the Retiring Titles table as retiring_titles.csv and save it to your Data folder in the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis folder.

21. Before you export your table, confirm that it looks like this image:

##Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program 

In the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file, write a query to create a Mentorship Eligibility table that holds the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

2. Retrieve the from_date and to_date columns from the Department Employee table.

5. Create a new table using the INTO clause.

6. Join the Employees and the Department Employee tables on the primary key.

7. Join the Employees and the Titles tables on the primary key.

8. Filter the data on the to_date column to all the current employees, then filter the data on the birth_date columns to get all the employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

9. Order the table by the employee number.

10. Export the Mentorship Eligibility table as mentorship_eligibilty.csv and save it to your Data folder in the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis folder.

11. Before you export your table, confirm that it looks like this image:

##Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report to help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

The analysis should contain the following:

1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

2. Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

3. Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

 - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

 - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
